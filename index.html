        <h3>Monthly Meetings</h3>
        <p>The garden club holds monthly meetings from February to November.  Most months the meeting will involve a speaker on a gardening related topic.<br>
        The exception to this is June when the club holds a bring and buy evening, this is an ideal time to get plants at a reduced price. <br>
        November is the last meeting of the year and is the presentation evening were the prizes from the annual show are given out. </p>
        <h3>Trading Shed</h3>
        <p>The trading shed provides members with the opportunity to purchase compost and fertilisers at a very competitive price, lower than all the local retail outlets. <br>
        We buy the fertilisers in bulk but as a member you can buy them in smaller sizes, they are priced by the kg. </p>
        <h3>Annual Show</h3>
        <p>The annual show is the highlight of the garden club year and has a variety of classes for vegetables, flowers, flower arranging, wine making and domestic.<br> With a dedicated childrens section
