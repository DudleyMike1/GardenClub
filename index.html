                <h3>Monthly Meetings</h3>
                <p>The garden club holds monthly meetings from February to November.  Most months the meeting will involve a speaker on a gardening related topic.<br>
                The exception to this is June when the club holds a bring and buy evening, this is an ideal time to get plants at a reduced price. <br>
                November is the last meeting of the year and is the presentation evening when the prizes from the annual show are given out. </p>
